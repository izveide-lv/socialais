# Linux Terminal Simulation with Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS

This project simulates a Linux terminal where users can execute commands and interact with the system just as they would in a real terminal. It provides an engaging and functional terminal-like experience, with interactive components built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Command Simulation**:
  - `ls`: Lists the contents of the current directory.
  - `pwd`: Displays the current directory path.
  - `cat`: Views the content of a specified file.
  - `open-image`: Opens and displays images in a modal.

- **Directory Navigation**: Navigate through directories and explore files just like in a real terminal environment.

- **Responsive Terminal-like Interface**: The application mimics a real terminal with command outputs displayed in an interactive format.

- **Modern Design**: Styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
